  - '"Ah! Jamp, watch out!!"'

  - '"W-Woah! Thank you, Lucy!"'
  - '"Who put this giant hole here?"'
  - '"This is a chasm! The fastest way to the bottom is to jump!"'
  - '"WHAT!? Are you crazy?"'
  - "\"Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s water at the bottom! You\u2019ll be fine!\""
  - "\"I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\""
  - '"You can do it, Jamp! I believe in you!"'
  - "\"Hmmm\u2026\""
  - '[CHOOSE]'
  - "\"A-alright. Here goes nothing\u2026\""
  - "\"1\u20262\u20263\u2026!\""
  - '"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"'
  - Jamp falls all the way to the bottom, but lands in a deep body of water, unharmed.
  - "\"Phew\u2026\""
  - Lucy floats down to meet him.
  - '"That was great!"'
  - "\"I\u2019m not taking compliments from someone who can just float!\""
  - '"Oh! Look! A sign!"'
  - "The sign reads, \u201CA Reward for a Courageous One!\u201D with a chest underneath
    it. Jamp opens it."
  - "\"Wow! Look at all this gold! And\u2026some kind of amulet\u2026?\""
  - "\"That amulet can give you a special power for a limited time! Isn\u2019t it
    cool?\""
  - '"I guess risking my life really was worth it!"'
  - Jamp's cooldown has been reduced for the next battle. Gained 1000 gold.
  - '[END]'
  - "\"Um\u2026I don\u2019t think so! L-let\u2019s just find another way down\u2026\""
  - "\"Boo, you\u2019re no fun! But fine, looks like there\u2019s a passage over
    there\u2026\""
  - Jamp and Lucy make their way down the winding passage until they finally reach
    the bottom.
  - "There, a sign reads, \u201CA Punishment for a Coward!\u201D, and a mysterious
    force steals some of Jamp\u2019s gold."
  - '"COME ON!! How is that fair!?"'
