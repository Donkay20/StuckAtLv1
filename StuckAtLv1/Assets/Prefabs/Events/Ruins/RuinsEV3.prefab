  - '"The sign reads, ''To choose, put a drop of blood into one bowl.''"'
  - "\"The bowl on the left has some kind of cloudy liquid inside. I can\u2019t see
    the bottom at all.\""
  - '"This other one is crystal clear, the bottom is filled with precious gems."'
  - "\"I won\u2019t tell you which to choose. It seems like you\u2019ll have to take
    a leap of faith.\""
  - '"..."'
  - '[CHOOSE]'
  - '"Alright gramps, I choose the cloudy bowl!"'
  - Jamp slices the tip of his finger, and lets a drop of blood fall into the bowl.
  - Suddenly, Jamp's artifact glows, but his wallet feels a little lighter.
  - '"Hey, my gold!"'
  - '"But you gained something in return, right?"'
  - "\"Yeah\u2026you\u2019re right! Surely whatever we encounter next will be a breeze!\""
  - Gained an upgrade. Lost 100 gold.
  - '[END]'
  - "\"Obviously I\u2019m going to choose the clear bowl! Look at all those gems!\""
  - Jamp slices the tip of his finger, and lets a drop of blood fall into the bowl.
  - Suddenly, Jamp feels a bit weaker, but a bunch of golden coins fly out of the
    bowl.
  - '"Ugh...  I feel a bit tired."'
  - '"But look at all the gold you gained!"'
  - '"Well yeah, but this still kind of sucks!"'
  - Movement speed decreased for the next battle. Gained 100 gold.
