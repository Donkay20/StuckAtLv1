  dialogue:
  - "\"This is a statue of the Queen, it\u2019s in a tranquil spot. I used to come
    here and leave coins in the fountain.\""
  - "\"I feel kind of conflicted looking at this\u2026 \""
  - '[CHOOSE]'
  - "\"She\u2019s still my mother after all\u2026I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to
    leave something.\""
  - Jamp tosses a coin into the fountain.
  - Jamp feels power swell within him; he feels light on his feet.
  - '"I feel more in tune with my admittedly small vampiric abilities. I guess that
    was worth it!"'
  - Jamp's dash has been enhanced for the next battle.
  - '[END]'
  - '"Honestly, what kind of mother disowns her own son?!"'
  - '"If I die on this journey, at least I can take out my rage on this dumb statue!"'
  - Jamp punts the statue. He is immediately struck by lightning.
  - '"OW!!!!!!! What the hell???"'
  - '"Hehe..."'
  - Jamp loses 50 HP.
  - '[END]'
  - "\"Everyone here is dead right? What use do they have for money? It wouldn\u2019t
    hurt to take a little bit\u2026right?\""
  - Jamp reaches into the fountain, and fishes around for a handful of coins.
  - '"..."'
  - '"Alright! Nothing happened!"'
  - "\"Phew\u2026I thought for sure she\u2019d strike you with lightning, or something
    like that.\""
  - "\"Mother would never do that to me! Now, let\u2019s keep going!\""
  - Jamp fished 500 gold from the fountain.
